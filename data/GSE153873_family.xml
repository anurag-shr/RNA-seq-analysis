RNA isolated from tissue was spiked with the ERCC Spike-In Mix (equal quantities) and subject to ribosomal RNA removal and sequencing library preparation.
Libraries were sequenced (75 bp, single-end) on a NextSeq 550 platform (Illumina) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol.

    <Data-Processing>
RNA-seq reads (including ERCC spike-in controls) were aligned to the human reference genome (assembly GRCh37.75/hg19 concatenated with the sequence of the ERCC transcripts) using STAR with default parameters. Only alignments with mapping score MAPQ of 10 and above were retained.
Read counts for the ERCC spike-in transcripts were counted using samtools idxstat function. FeatureCounts was used to generate a matrix of mapped fragments per RefSeq annotated gene.

RNA isolated from tissue was spiked with the ERCC Spike-In Mix (equal quantities) and subject to ribosomal RNA removal and sequencing library preparation.
Libraries were sequenced (75 bp, single-end) on a NextSeq 550 platform (Illumina) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol.

    </Channel>
    <Data-Processing>
RNA-seq reads (including ERCC spike-in controls) were aligned to the human reference genome (assembly GRCh37.75/hg19 concatenated with the sequence of the ERCC transcripts) using STAR with default parameters. Only alignments with mapping score MAPQ of 10 and above were retained.
Read counts for the ERCC spike-in transcripts were counted using samtools idxstat function. FeatureCounts was used to generate a matrix of mapped fragments per RefSeq annotated gene.

RNA-seq reads (including ERCC spike-in controls) were aligned to the human reference genome (assembly GRCh37.75/hg19 concatenated with the sequence of the ERCC transcripts) using STAR with default parameters. Only alignments with mapping score MAPQ of 10 and above were retained.
Read counts for the ERCC spike-in transcripts were counted using samtools idxstat function. FeatureCounts was used to generate a matrix of mapped fragments per RefSeq annotated gene.

RNA isolated from tissue was spiked with the ERCC Spike-In Mix (equal quantities) and subject to ribosomal RNA removal and sequencing library preparation.
Libraries were sequenced (75 bp, single-end) on a NextSeq 550 platform (Illumina) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol.
      </Extract-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Data-Processing>
RNA-seq reads (including ERCC spike-in controls) were aligned to the human reference genome (assembly GRCh37.75/hg19 concatenated with the sequence of the ERCC transcripts) using STAR with default parameters. Only alignments with mapping score MAPQ of 10 and above were retained.
Read counts for the ERCC spike-in transcripts were counted using samtools idxstat function. FeatureCounts was used to generate a matrix of mapped fragments per RefSeq annotated gene.
